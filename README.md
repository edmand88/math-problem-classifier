# math-problem-classifier

This is a classifier that classifies math problems into 5 categories (Algebra, Counting & Probability, Geometry, Precalculus and Number Theory) with a test accuracy of around 75% on AMC problems.

- The model was trained on AMC problems found on the math-problems_df.csv file. Please refer to math_problems_classifier.ipynb for the training code of the model.

- To use the model, install Python version 3.11, along with numpy, pandas, tensorflow, and scikit-learn. After installation, open test.ipynb and run the cells (from top to bottom). Input your math problem in "new_text" in the last cell and run. The output will be at the bottom of the cell.

- If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please let me know!

Have fun!
