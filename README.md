# math-problem-classifier

This is a classifier that classifies math problems into 5 categories (Algebra, Counting & Probability, Geometry, Precalculus and Number Theory) with a test accuracy of around 75% on AMC problems.

- The model was trained on AMC problems found on the math-problems_df.csv file. Please refer to math_problems_classifier.ipynb for the training code of the model.

- To use the model, download all the files present in this repository. Then, install Python version 3.10.14, along with numpy version 1.25.2, pandas version 2.0.3, tensorflow version 2.15.0, and the most recent version of scikit-learn version 1.4.2. After installation, open test.ipynb and run the cells (from top to bottom). Input your math problem in "new_text" in the last cell and run. The output will be at the bottom of the cell.

- If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please let me know!

Have fun!
